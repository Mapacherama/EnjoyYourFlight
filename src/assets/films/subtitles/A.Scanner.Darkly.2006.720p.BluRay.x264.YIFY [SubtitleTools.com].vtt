00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.724
Anna. Elsa.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.055
Bedtime soon.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.053
Uh-oh. The princess is trapped

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.683
in the snow goblin's
evil spell.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.474
Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.727
Oh, no!
The prince is trapped, too.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.384
Who cares about danger

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.528
when there's love?

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.231
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.321
Kissing won't save the Forest.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.698
The lost fairies cry out.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.308
What sound
does a giraffe make?

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.368
Never mind.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.619
They wake the fairy queen...

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.456
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.416
And they all get married!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:30.923
What are you playing?

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:32.544
Enchanted Forest.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:33.987
The prince and the princess...

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:36.378
Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.388
You've seen
an enchanted forest?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.474
Wait, what?

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.554
I have. Once.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.186
And you've never
told us this before?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.312
Well, I could tell you now,
if you...

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.475
- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.109
Are you sure about this?

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.570
It's time they know.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.342
Let's make
a big snowman later.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.857
If they can settle and listen.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.032
Far away...

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.037
as north as we can go...

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.826
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.786
But its magic wasn't that of

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.247
goblin spells
and lost fairies.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.633
<i>It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...</i>

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.881
<i>those of air...</i>

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.555
<i>of fire...</i>

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:21.840
<i>of water...</i>

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:24.350
<i>and earth.</i>

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.765
<i>But it was also home</i>

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.771
<i>to the mysterious
Northuldra people.</i>

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.607
<i>Were the
Northuldra magical, like me?</i>

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.319
<i>No, Elsa.
They were not magical.</i>

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.701
<i>They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts.</i>

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.534
<i>Their ways
were so different from ours...</i>

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.290
<i>but still,
they promised us friendship.</i>

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.246
<i>In honor of that,</i>

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.203
<i>your grandfather,
King Runeard,</i>

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.663
<i>built them a mighty dam...</i>

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.422
<i>to strengthen their waters.</i>

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.167
<i>It was a gift of peace.</i>

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.301
<i>That's a big gift of peace.</i>

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.178
<i>And I was so honored</i>

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.130
<i>to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it.</i>

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.515
Stand tall, Agnarr.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.976
<i>I wasn't at all prepared</i>

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.348
<i>for what the day would bring.</i>

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.685
<i>We let down our guard.</i>

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.022
<i>We were charmed.</i>

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.691
Whoa. Whoa!

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.857
<i>It felt so...</i>

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.034
<i>magical.</i>

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.378
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.007
<i>They were attacking us.</i>

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:43.884
Get behind me.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.258
<i>It was a brutal battle.</i>

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.956
<i>Your grandfather...</i>

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.980
Father!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.064
...<i>was lost.</i>

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.185
Aah!

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.267
<i>The fighting
enraged the spirits.</i>

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:57.439
Look out!

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.695
<i>They turned
their magic against us all.</i>

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.041
<i>There was this voice...</i>

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.169
<i>...and someone saved me.</i>

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.512
<i>I'm told
the spirits then vanished.</i>

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:29.767
<i>And a powerful mist
covered the Forest.</i>

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.178
<i>Locking everyone out.</i>

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:41.358
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.867
Whoa, Papa, that was epic.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.120
Whoever saved you,

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.289
I love them.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.206
I wish I knew who it was.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.375
What happened to the spirits?

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.877
What's in the Forest now?

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.583
I don't know.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.090
The mist still stands.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.000
No one can get in.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.885
And no one has since come out.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.216
So we're safe.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.389
Yes.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.423
But the Forest
could wake again.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:13.436
And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:14.891
And on that note,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.501
how about we say good night
to your father?

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.984
But I still have
so many questions.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.940
Save them
for another night, Anna.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.818
You know I don't have
that kind of patience.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.780
Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.866
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.747
Do you think
the Forest will wake again?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.043
Only Ahtohallan knows.

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.038
Octa-who-what?

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.133
When I was little...

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.877
my mother would sing a song

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.463
about a special river
called Ahtohallan...

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.507
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.722
About what we are a part of.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:54.895
Wow.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.972
Will you sing it for us?
Please?

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.733
Okay.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.733
Cuddle close.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.028
Scooch in.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.738
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.029
<i>Meets the sea</i>

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.158
<i>There's a river</i>

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.247
<i>Full of memory</i>

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:24.291
<i>Sleep, my darling,
safe and sound</i>

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:29.132
<i>For in this river,
all is found</i>

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.135
<i>In her waters</i>

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:38.055
<i>Deep and true</i>

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.224
<i>Lie the answers</i>

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.859
<i>And a path for you</i>

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.939
<i>Dive down deep into her sound</i>

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:53.570
<i>But not too far
or you'll be drowned</i>

00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:01.912
<i>Yes, she will sing
to those who hear</i>

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:08.551
<i>And in her song,
all magic flows</i>

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:13.507
<i>But can you brave
what you most fear?</i>

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:20.855
<i>Can you face
what the river knows?</i>

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.152
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.359
<i>Meets the sea</i>

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.616
<i>There's a mother</i>

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.779
<i>Full of memory</i>

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:40.496
<i>Come, my darling,
homeward bound</i>

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.918
<i>When all is lost</i>

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:49.335
<i>Then all is found</i>

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.884
- Your Majesty.
- Oh!

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.056
They're ready.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.551
Excuse me.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.310
I'm coming.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.128
Do you hear that?

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.152
What?

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.275
Never mind.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.131
Enjoying
your new permafrost, Olaf?

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:36.012
I'm just living the dream,
Anna.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.099
How I wish

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.674
- this could last forever.
- Mmm.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.186
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.355
What's that?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.477
Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.483
Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing...

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.610
do you ever worry
about the notion that...

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.316
nothing is permanent?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.277
Uh... No.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.567
Really?

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.402
Wow, I can't wait until
I'm ancient like you...

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.197
so I don't have to worry
about important things.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.453
That's not what I mean.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.492
I don't worry because...

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.334
well, I have you and Elsa
and Kristoff and Sven...

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.837
and the gates are open wide...

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.717
and I'm not alone anymore.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.972
<i>Yes, the wind blows
a little bit colder</i>

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.882
<i>And we're all getting older</i>

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.146
<i>And the clouds are moving on
With every autumn breeze</i>

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.974
<i>Peter Pumpkin
just became fertilizer</i>

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.643
<i>And my leaf's a little sadder
and wiser</i>

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.155
<i>That's why I rely
on certain certainties</i>

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:39.403
<i>Yes, some things never change</i>

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.696
<i>Like the feel
of your hand in mine</i>

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.453
<i>Some things stay the same</i>

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.583
<i>Like how we get along
just fine</i>

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.712
<i>Like an old stone wall
that'll never fall</i>

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.419
<i>Some things are always true!</i>

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.091
<i>Some things never change</i>

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.472
<i>Like how
I'm holding on tight to you</i>

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.596
<i>The leaves are already falling</i>

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.390
<i>Sven, it feels
like the future is calling</i>

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.853
<i>Are you telling me tonight</i>

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.403
<i>You're gonna get down
on one knee?</i>

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.486
<i>Yeah, but I'm really bad
at planning these things out</i>

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.155
<i>Like candlelight
and pulling of rings out</i>

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.948
<i>Maybe you should leave
all the romantic stuff to me!</i>

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.542
<i>Yeah, some things never change</i>

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.998
<i>Like the love
that I feel for her</i>

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.835
<i>Some things stay the same</i>

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.091
<i>Like how reindeers are easier</i>

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.011
<i>But if I commit
and I go for it</i>

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.888
<i>I'll know what to say and do!</i>

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.058
<i>Right?</i>

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:46.560
<i>Some things never change</i>

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:49.016
<i>Sven, the pressure
is all on you</i>

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.069
<i>The winds are restless</i>

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.323
<i>Could that be why
I'm hearing this call?</i>

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.074
<i>Is something coming?</i>

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:04.203
<i>I'm not sure
I want things to change at all</i>

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.034
<i>These days are precious</i>

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.950
<i>Can't let them slip away</i>

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.294
<i>I can't freeze this moment</i>

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:18.300
<i>But I can still go out
and seize this day!</i>

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.847
Oh!

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.149
<i>The wind blows
a little bit colder</i>

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.857
<i>And you all look
a little bit older</i>

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.729
<i>It's time to count
our blessings</i>

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.362
<i>Beneath an autumn sky</i>

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.198
<i>We'll always live
in a kingdom of plenty</i>

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.863
<i>That stands
for the good of the many!</i>

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:52.126
<i>And I promise you the flag of
Arendelle will always fly!</i>

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.753
<i>Our flag will always fly!</i>

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.924
<i>Our flag will always fly
Our flag will always fly</i>

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.927
<i>Some things never change</i>

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.053
<i>Turn around
and the time has flown</i>

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.342
<i>Some things stay the same</i>

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.555
<i>Though the future
remains unknown</i>

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.312
<i>May our good luck last
May our past be past</i>

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:16.226
<i>Time's moving fast, it's true</i>

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.440
<i>Some things never change</i>

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.191
<i>And I'm holding on tight
to you</i>

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.734
<i>Holding on tight to you</i>

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:29.071
<i>- Holding on tight to you
- Holding on tight to you</i>

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:36.955
<i>I'm holding on tight to you</i>

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.803
Uh, okay.
Um, lion?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:45.973
Grizzly bear?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.137
- Uh, monster?
- Brown bear?

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.390
- Angry face?
- Black bear?

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.557
- Uh...
- Hans?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.852
Unredeemable monster?

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:52.998
Greatest mistake of your life?

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.308
Wouldn't even kiss you?

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:56.724
Villain!

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.104
Oh!

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.230
We all kind of got it.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.520
Okay, Olaf, you're up.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:01.655
Okay.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.526
So much easier
now that I can read.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.616
Mm.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.738
Lightning round,
boys against girls.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.699
Okay, I'm ready,
I'm ready. Go.

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:11.707
Unicorn.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.907
Ice cream!

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.583
Castle! Oaken!

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.368
Teapot! Mouse!

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.120
Oh! Elsa!

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.003
I don't think
Olaf should get to rearrange.

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.821
Doesn't matter. This is gonna
be a cinch.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.383
Two sisters, one mind.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.138
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.515
Here we go.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.220
You got this, Elsa.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.093
- Hmm.
- Anytime.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.765
Just do it with your body.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:35.972
Uh, nothing?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.516
Air? Tree? People?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:39.979
Treeple?
Oh, that's not a word.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.985
Oh, shovel boy? Teeth?

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.107
Oh! Doing the dishes?

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.281
- Polar bear?
- Hey.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.606
- Sorry.
- Uh... Ugh.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.760
You gotta
give me something.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.946
Um...

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.824
Oh! Uh, alarmed?

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.704
Distracted?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.282
Um, worried?
Panicking? Disturbed?

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.583
Oh, come on,
you definitely

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.331
look disturbed.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.421
We won.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.505
Rematch?

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.582
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll turn in.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760
Are you okay?

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:07.010
Just... Just tired.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.382
Good night.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.950
Yeah, I'm tired, too.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.011
And Sven promised to read me
a bedtime story.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.683
Didn't you, Sven?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:14.853
Did I?

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.974
Oh, you do the best voices!

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:19.606
Like when you pretend to be
Kristoff, and you're like...

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.670
"I just
need to go talk to some rocks

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.026
"about my childhood
and stuff."

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.694
Um, how about you guys

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.397
start without me?

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.785
Ugh.

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:34.909
Did Elsa seem weird to you?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.791
- She seemed like Elsa.
- Hmm.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.288
That last word

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.291
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:42.921
- I don't know. Ahem.
- No. No.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.673
- I don't know, but...
- Ah.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.259
"Ice"?

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:47.960
Oh, come on!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.966
She couldn't act out ice?

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.755
- I better go check on her.
- Uh...

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.636
- Thanks, honey. Love you.
- Hmm?

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.514
Love you, too.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.397
It's fine.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.650
Come in.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.896
Yep. Something's wrong.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.861
- With you?
- No, with you.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.783
You're wearing Mother's scarf.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.910
You do that
when something's wrong.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.828
Did we hurt
your feelings?

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.330
I'm so sorry if we did.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.784
You know, very few people are
actually good at family games.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:20.877
That's just a fact.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.124
No, that's not it.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.754
Then, what is it?

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.001
There's this...

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.719
I just don't wanna
mess things up.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.885
What things?
You're doing great.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.097
Oh, Elsa, when are you
going to see yourself

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.476
the way I see you?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.526
What would I do without you?

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.858
You'll always have me.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.108
I know what you need.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:53.362
- Come on, come here.
- What?

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.694
In Mama's words,

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.495
- "cuddle close, scooch in."
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.460
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.837
<i>Meets the sea</i>

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.715
<i>There's a river</i>

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.134
<i>Full of memory</i>

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.132
I know what you're doing.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:17.762
<i>Sleep, my darling,
safe and sound</i>

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:22.726
<i>For in this river,
all is found</i>

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.815
<i>I can hear you</i>

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.479
<i>But I won't</i>

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.902
<i>Some look for trouble</i>

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.692
<i>While others don't</i>

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.331
<i>There's a thousand reasons
I should go about my day</i>

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.916
<i>And ignore your whispers
which I wish would go away, oh</i>

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.667
<i>Oh</i>

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.550
<i>You're not a voice</i>

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.177
<i>You're just
a ringing in my ear</i>

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.850
<i>And if I heard you</i>

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.052
<i>Which I don't</i>

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.516
<i>I'm spoken for, I fear</i>

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.730
<i>Everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls</i>

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.027
<i>I'm sorry, Secret Siren</i>

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.400
<i>But I'm blocking out
your calls</i>

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.534
<i>I've had my adventure
I don't need something new</i>

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:02.697
<i>I'm afraid of what I'm risking
if I follow you</i>

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:06.867
<i>Into the unknown</i>

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.460
<i>Into the unknown</i>

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:17.010
<i>Into the unknown</i>

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.971
<i>What do you want?</i>

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.644
<i>'Cause you've been
keeping me awake</i>

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.443
<i>Are you here to distract me</i>

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.696
<i>So I make a big mistake?</i>

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.484
<i>Or are you someone out there</i>

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.903
<i>Who's a little bit like me</i>

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.823
<i>Who knows deep down</i>

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.334
<i>I'm not where I'm meant to be?</i>

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.212
<i>Every day's a little harder</i>

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.873
<i>As I feel my power grow</i>

00:18:55.051 --> 00:19:00.137
<i>Don't you know there's
part of me that longs to go</i>

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:04.676
<i>Into the unknown?</i>

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:12.061
<i>Into the unknown!</i>

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.113
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.112
<i>Are you out there?
Do you know me?</i>

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:25.620
<i>Can you feel me?
Can you show me?</i>

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:48.052
<i>Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone</i>

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:52.894
<i>How do I follow you</i>

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:59.155
<i>Into the unknown?</i>

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:14.119
Air, fire, water, earth.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.895
The water!

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.990
The air rages,
no fire, no water.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.491
The earth is next.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.741
We have to get out.

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:57.079
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.505
Oh, no!
I'm gonna blow!

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.087
I've got you!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.473
Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.103
- Here. Take one of these.
- Huh?

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.355
You okay there, Olaf?

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:21.440
Oh, yeah.
We're calling this...

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.739
"controlling what you can when
things feel out of control."

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.442
Okay, I don't understand.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.110
You've been hearing a voice

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.991
and you didn't think
to tell me?

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:31.280
I didn't want to worry you.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.200
We made a promise
not to shut each other out.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.082
Just tell me what's going on.

00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:41.791
I woke the magical spirits
at the Enchanted Forest.

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.504
Okay, that's definitely not

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:44.960
what I thought
you were gonna say.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.675
Wait. The Enchanted Forest?

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.464
The one
Father warned us about?

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:50.558
Yes.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:51.929
Why would you do that?

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:54.435
Because of the voice.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.348
I know it sounds crazy...

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:00.142
but I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:03.027
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:07.232
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:08.866
I can feel it.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.327
Okay.

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:13.996
Oh, no. What now?

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.078
The Trolls?

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:19.120
- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:20.797
Pabbie.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:23.749
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.211
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:30.802
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:32.841
Why are they still angry?

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.898
What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:37.053
Let me see what I can see.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.393
The past is not what it seems.

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:47.063
A wrong demands to be righted.

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:50.109
Arendelle is not safe.

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:53.575
The truth must be found.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:54.863
Without it...

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:58.249
I see no future.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.455
No future?

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:02.871
When one can see no future...

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:06.379
all one can do
is the next right thing.

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.044
The next right thing

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:10.778
is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest...

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.388
and find that voice.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.827
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:14.851
- and Sven?
- Hmm?

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.538
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:18.770
- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no.

00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:21.314
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.086
Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain...

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.110
survived a frozen heart,

00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:25.380
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.736
and I did it
all without powers,

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.300
so, you know, I'm coming.

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.656
Me, too. I'll drive.

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.153
I'll bring the snacks!

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:33.280
I will look after your people.

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:34.494
Please make sure they stay

00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:35.949
out of the kingdom
until we return.

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:37.580
Of course.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.116
Let's let them know.

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.036
Anna, I am worried for her.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.623
We have always feared

00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:46.252
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:49.839
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.714
I won't let anything
happen to her.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.677
Hyah!

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.936
Who's into trivia?

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.642
I am. Okay.

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.308
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:07.485
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:08.896
Did you know men are six times

00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.480
more likely
to be struck by lightning?

00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:12.741
Did you know gorillas burp
when they're happy?

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.197
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:17.203
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:18.725
Did you know
sleeping quietly

00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:20.456
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.355
- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is.

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:24.606
- It's true.
- Definitely true.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.149
No, it's the truth.

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:27.539
Well,
that was unanimous.

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:29.503
But I will look it up
when we get home.

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.670
They're both asleep.

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:36.890
So, what do you wanna do?

00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:42.016
Sven, keep us steady, will ya?

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:45.686
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:46.920
- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?

00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:48.606
Remember
our first trip like this...

00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:50.862
when I said
you'd have to be crazy

00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:52.610
to want to marry
a man you just met?

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.316
Wait, what? Crazy?

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.860
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:58.490
No. I did.

00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:00.371
- You were...
- Huh?

00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:01.538
...not crazy.

00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:02.916
Clearly.

00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.618
Just naive.

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:08.334
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:12.759
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:14.794
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.964
What? No, no. I'm not saying

00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:19.470
you're wrong, or crazy.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.643
- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea.

00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.303
I hear it. I hear the voice.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.721
You do?

00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:27.649
Olaf, wake up.

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:33.313
- Whoa.
- Wow.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:59.096
Whoa! What the...

00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:19.738
Whoa.

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:29.582
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.121
I promise.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.926
It's okay.

00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.218
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.893
is a place of transformation?

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.804
I have no idea
what that means...

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:49.722
but I can't wait to see

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:53.151
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:56.028
- Hey!
- What is this?

00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:57.550
- No pushing.
- Stop it.

00:26:57.574 --> 00:26:59.214
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast.

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:00.658
What was that?

00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:03.995
No. No, no, no.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.912
And we're locked in.

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.641
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:14.168
This forest is beautiful.

00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:15.925
Ooh.

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:43.531
The dam. It still stands.

00:27:43.704 --> 00:27:46.321
It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.830
But why?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.743
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:51.955
What do you mean?

00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:53.126
Well, if that dam broke...

00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.254
it would send
a tidal wave so big

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.627
it would wash away everything
on this fjord.

00:27:57.801 --> 00:27:59.212
Everything?

00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:01.090
But Arendelle's on this fjord.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:03.805
Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna.

00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:05.098
It's gonna be fine.

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:07.008
Come here.

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:15.354
You know,
under different circumstances,

00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:18.687
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.780
Don't you think?

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:20.865
Different circumstances?

00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:22.177
You mean,
like with someone else?

00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:23.908
What? No! No.

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:25.360
I'm saying...

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:26.681
Just in case we don't make it
out of here...

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:27.705
Wait, what?

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.184
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:30.208
No. No!

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:32.079
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:33.646
Well, technically the odds are
kind of complicated,

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.870
but my point is...

00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:36.379
In case we die...

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.881
- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no.

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.195
- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point.

00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:41.446
I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.697
Not in any
recent time will we die.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.115
- Elsa!
- But way far in the future,

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.425
we will die.

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.477
Don't patronize me.

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:01.446
Elsa!

00:29:01.615 --> 00:29:02.856
There you are.

00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:04.945
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

00:29:05.118 --> 00:29:06.700
Okay, good.

00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:08.657
Where's Olaf?

00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:10.280
Um...

00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:11.455
Anna?

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.203
Elsa?

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.788
Sven?

00:29:15.337 --> 00:29:16.953
Samantha?

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:22.383
I don't even know a Samantha.

00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.553
Whoa!

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:30.142
Mm.

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.516
That's normal.

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:48.864
What was that?

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:51.122
Samantha?

00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:59.500
<i>This will all
make sense when I am older</i>

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:03.671
<i>Someday I will see
that this makes sense</i>

00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:08.130
<i>One day when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize</i>

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:11.425
<i>That these were all
completely normal events!</i>

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:17.938
<i>I'll have all the answers
when I'm older</i>

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:22.273
<i>Like why we're in this
dark enchanted wood</i>

00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:24.529
<i>I know in a couple years</i>

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:26.526
<i>These will seem
like childish fears</i>

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:29.359
<i>And so I know this isn't bad,
it's good</i>

00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.777
<i>Excuse me</i>

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:35.411
<i>Growing up means adapting</i>

00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:39.285
<i>Puzzling out your world
and your place</i>

00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:43.707
<i>When I'm more mature
I'll feel totally secure</i>

00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:47.844
<i>Being watched by something
with a creepy, creepy face</i>

00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:02.525
<i>See, that will all make sense
when I am older</i>

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:06.104
<i>So there's no need
to be terrified or tense</i>

00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.654
<i>I'll just dream about a time</i>

00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:14.491
<i>When I'm in my agèd prime</i>

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:17.031
<i>'Cause when you're older</i>

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:22.375
<i>Absolutely everything
makes sense!</i>

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.754
This is fine.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.625
- Whoa!
- Olaf!

00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:33.472
Hey, guys.

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:35.429
Meet the Wind Spirit.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.511
Coming through!

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:40.433
Ooh, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:43.312
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:52.950
Hey! Stop!

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:06.257
Elsa!

00:32:09.428 --> 00:32:11.090
Let her go!

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.841
Anna, be careful!

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:19.101
That's my sister!

00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:24.849
Prince Agnarr!

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.945
For Arendelle.

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:33.823
Look out!

00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:36.807
Father!

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:47.747
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:51.171
What are these?

00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:54.925
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.469
What's that thing
you say, Olaf?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.133
The thing... Oh!

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:01.139
My theory
about advancing technologies

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.640
as both our savior
and our doom?

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:04.973
No, not that one.
The one about...

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:06.306
- The one about cucumbers?
- No.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.359
The thing about water.

00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:09.777
Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory.

00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.608
The water
that makes up you and me

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:13.655
has passed through
at least four humans...

00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:15.654
and/or animals before us.

00:33:16.578 --> 00:33:17.578
Hmm.

00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:20.367
And remembers everything.

00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:23.620
The wind's back.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.827
Delicious.

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.747
I think I'll name you Gale.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.291
Get out of there. Whoa!

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:34.801
- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.805
You in a better mood now?

00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:52.153
Father. That's Father.

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:55.406
This girl.

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:57.191
She's saving him.

00:33:57.744 --> 00:33:59.155
She's Northuldra.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.826
What is that?

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.740
Olaf, get behind me.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.660
What are you gonna do
with that?

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:09.794
I have no idea.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.227
Lower your weapon.

00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:28.056
And you lower yours.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:29.849
Arendellian soldiers?

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.143
Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.562
Invading my dance space,
Yelena?

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.259
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:37.283
No, no, no.

00:34:37.534 --> 00:34:38.534
Lieutenant!

00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:39.618
Get the sword!

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:49.038
That was magic.

00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:50.453
Did you see that?

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.166
Of course I saw it.

00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:54.548
You chose a nice,
cold greeting.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.394
They've been trapped in here
this whole time?

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:57.794
- Yeah.
- What do we do now?

00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.013
I got this.

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.013
Hi, I'm Olaf.

00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:05.635
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.104
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:09.810
It's really quite simple.

00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:12.191
It began with two sisters.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.022
One born with magical powers.

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.527
One born powerless.

00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:17.438
Their love of snowmen,
infinite.

00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:19.027
Anna, no! Too high!

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.469
Blast!

00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:21.984
Mama! Papa! Help!

00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:24.154
Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere.

00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:26.243
Sisters torn apart.

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:28.373
Well, at least
they have their parents.

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.284
Their parents are dead.

00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.210
Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:33.538
I'll marry a man I just met.

00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:35.026
Elsa's gonna blow!

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.417
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.467
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:41.090
I live.

00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:43.802
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.807
Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!

00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:46.894
My heart.

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:47.978
Oh, my goodness.

00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.832
Only an act
of true love can save you.

00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:51.643
Here's a true love's kiss.

00:35:52.442 --> 00:35:53.649
You're not worth it.

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.184
Guess what? I'm the bad guy.

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:56.362
What?

00:35:56.863 --> 00:36:00.027
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:01.732
Oh, Anna.

00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:03.738
Then she unfreezes!

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.473
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:06.849
and we were forced
out of our kingdom.

00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.517
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:09.852
but we don't have a clue
how to do that...

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.242
except Elsa's hearing voices,

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:12.688
so we got that going for us.

00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:14.123
Any questions?

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.632
I think they got it.

00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:21.923
Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?

00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:23.133
I am.

00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:24.422
Why would nature reward

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.303
a person of Arendelle
with magic?

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:28.513
Perhaps to make up for
the actions of your people.

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:30.394
My people are innocent.

00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.429
We would have never
attacked first.

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:33.973
May the truth be found.

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:36.184
- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry.

00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.813
- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm.

00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.108
That's it. Lieutenant Mattias!

00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.897
Library, second portrait
on the left.

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:44.283
You were
our father's official guard.

00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:46.573
Agnarr.

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:48.533
What did happen
to your parents?

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:51.536
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea...

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.826
six years ago.

00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:00.629
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760
Really?

00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:02.961
Soldiers.

00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:06.256
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:08.595
And proud to serve Arendelle.

00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:11.685
Wait. Please.

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.767
Someone has called me here.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.932
If I can just find them...

00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:17.316
I believe
they have the answers

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.769
that may help us
free this forest.

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.278
Trust me, I just want to help.

00:37:22.615 --> 00:37:24.402
We only trust nature.

00:37:24.993 --> 00:37:26.655
When nature speaks...

00:37:29.372 --> 00:37:30.408
...we listen.

00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:32.740
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:35.668
Fire Spirit!

00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:38.705
Get back, everyone!

00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:40.714
Head for the river!

00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.969
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.062
Come on, Sven!

00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:56.017
We'll get them.

00:37:58.902 --> 00:38:00.814
Elsa! Get out of there!

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.780
No, no, no.

00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.702
Elsa!

00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.881
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:28.758
Anna!

00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:34.728
Oh!

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.266
Get her out of here.

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:38.647
No! Elsa!

00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:54.932
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:58.143
Got any advice?

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:01.434
Nothing?

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.566
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:08.987
You hear it, too.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.448
Somebody's calling us.

00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:14.364
Who is it?
What do we do?

00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:24.753
Okay, keep going north.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:28.550
Elsa!

00:40:28.718 --> 00:40:29.879
- Oh, thank goodness!
- Anna.

00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:31.794
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:33.087
You could've been killed.

00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.013
You can't just follow me
into fire.

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:37.470
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.143
then don't run into fire.

00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:43.351
You're not being careful,
Elsa.

00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:47.893
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:50.316
I've been better.

00:40:50.406 --> 00:40:53.365
Hmm. I know what you need.

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:58.404
Where did you get that scarf?

00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:01.161
That's a Northuldra scarf.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:02.334
What?

00:41:02.543 --> 00:41:04.956
This is from one of
our oldest families.

00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:07.079
It was our mother's.

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:17.340
Elsa.

00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:18.598
I see it.

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:20.259
It's Mother.

00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:24.271
Mother saved Father's life
that day.

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:30.690
Our mother was Northuldra.

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.794
We are called Northuldra.

00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:36.927
We are the people of the sun.

00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:42.596
I promise you
I will free this forest...

00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.135
and restore Arendelle.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.472
That's a pretty big promise,
Elsa.

00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:51.855
Free the Forest?
Wow.

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.403
I'm sorry.

00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.208
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.273
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.531
I get it.

00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:00.442
- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:01.947
I heard the voice again.

00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:03.157
We need to go north.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:06.074
But the Earth Giants now roam
the north at night.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.082
You can leave in the morning.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.288
I'm Honeymaren.

00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:11.704
Honeymaren,
we'll do all we can.

00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:16.629
Hey, let me ask you.

00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:17.884
How do you guys cope...

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.087
with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.298
that comes with maturity?

00:43:23.142 --> 00:43:24.804
Brilliant!

00:43:24.894 --> 00:43:25.930
Oh!

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.103
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.604
Our future's in bright hands.

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.015
Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that.

00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:32.899
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:34.776
I can't seem
to get her attention.

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.319
Or even say the right thing.

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.816
Well, you're in luck.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.947
I know nothing about women.

00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:41.158
But I do know that we have

00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:43.861
the most amazing
way of proposing.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:44.955
If we start now,

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.391
- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.415
Best part,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.241
it involves
a lot of reindeer.

00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:50.871
Whoa.

00:43:51.254 --> 00:43:52.414
Hey, back at home...

00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:54.246
Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?

00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:55.382
She is.

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.002
Really?
She married?

00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.212
Mm-mm.

00:43:58.386 --> 00:44:01.379
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:03.172
What else do you miss?

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:05.591
My father.

00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.472
He passed
long before all this.

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:11.309
He was a great man.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.973
Built us a good life
in Arendelle.

00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:15.939
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:18.399
He'd say, "Be prepared.

00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.050
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

00:44:20.074 --> 00:44:22.862
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:25.201
What do you do when it does?

00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.828
Don't give up.

00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:29.907
Take it one step
at a time and...

00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:32.834
Just do the next right thing?

00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:34.620
Yeah.

00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:35.750
You got it.

00:44:39.135 --> 00:44:42.128
I wanna show you something.
May I?

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:47.474
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560
Yes.

00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:50.524
But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.897
said to be a bridge between us
and the magic of nature.

00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:55.273
A fifth spirit?

00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:56.684
Some say

00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:59.315
they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell.

00:44:59.488 --> 00:45:01.150
My father heard it.

00:45:01.324 --> 00:45:03.281
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:07.908
Maybe.
Alas, only Ahtohallan knows.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.696
Ahtohallan.

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:15.456
<i>Dive down deep
into her sound</i>

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.124
<i>But not too far
or you'll be drowned</i>

00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:22.255
Why do lullabies
always have to have

00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:23.836
some terrible warning in them?

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.796
I wonder that all the time.

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.516
Earth Giants.

00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:31.927
What are they doing down here?

00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:34.471
Shh!

00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:35.935
Hide.

00:45:45.451 --> 00:45:47.113
They're coming!

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.999
This is why
we don't play with fire.

00:45:59.382 --> 00:46:02.625
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:31.449
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:34.323
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:36.033
Or what if they can crush you

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:38.039
before you even get
the chance?

00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:41.835
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:44.625
find the truth,
and get us home.

00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:47.128
Hey, guys.
That was close.

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:48.591
I know.

00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.968
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:53.050
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:54.677
And you're right, Anna.

00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:56.641
We've got to find the voice.

00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:57.895
We're going now.

00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.306
Okay. We're going.

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:00.724
Let me just...

00:47:03.112 --> 00:47:05.729
Wait.
Where are Kristoff and Sven?

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.190
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:09.491
and a bunch of reindeer.

00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:10.863
- They left?
- Mm-hmm.

00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:13.320
Just left
without saying anything?

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.534
Who knows the ways of men?

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.165
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.795
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.714
Everyone ready?

00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.804
Ready!

00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.199
Uh,
I could use a rehearsal.

00:47:31.223 --> 00:47:32.284
I love love.

00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.049
Wait. You talk for them, too?

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:35.226
I do.

00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.164
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:39.396
Yeah. And then
you just say it.

00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:41.181
And then you just say it.

00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:45.895
Okay. Here she comes.

00:47:47.323 --> 00:47:49.406
Princess Anna of Arendelle...

00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:53.785
my feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:56.367
Will you marry me?

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.616
Um...

00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:59.709
No.

00:48:00.086 --> 00:48:01.952
The princess left
with the queen.

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.961
What? Wait, what? What?

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:07.215
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:08.717
Long gone?

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.299
So, yeah.

00:48:12.598 --> 00:48:15.136
Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows.

00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:16.842
You can come with us
if you want.

00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:24.642
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.811
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah. Yep.

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:30.689
Okay, I better
go pack. You coming with?

00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:32.490
I'll just...
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.488
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:35.944
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:37.245
I know the woods.

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:53.762
<i>Reindeers
are better than people</i>

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:58.596
<i>Sven, why is love so hard?</i>

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.970
<i>You feel what you feel</i>

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:04.891
<i>And those feelings are real</i>

00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:06.812
<i>Come on, Kristoff</i>

00:49:06.986 --> 00:49:11.196
<i>Let down your guard</i>

00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:26.871
<i>Again, you're gone</i>

00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:31.625
<i>Off on a diff'rent path
than mine</i>

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.543
<i>I'm left behind</i>

00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:38.056
<i>Wondering if I should follow</i>

00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:40.809
<i>You had to go</i>

00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:45.772
<i>And, of course,
it's always fine</i>

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.646
<i>I prob'ly could catch up
with you tomorrow</i>

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:58.910
<i>But is this what it feels like
to be growing apart?</i>

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.038
<i>When did I become the one</i>

00:50:02.124 --> 00:50:05.743
<i>Who's always
chasing your heart?</i>

00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:08.541
<i>Now I turn around
and find</i>

00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:11.923
<i>I am lost in the woods</i>

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:15.343
<i>North is South
Right is left</i>

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:18.631
<i>When you're gone</i>

00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:21.424
<i>I'm the one who sees you home</i>

00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:25.221
<i>But now I'm lost in the woods</i>

00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:30.234
<i>And I don't know
what path you are on</i>

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:33.737
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:40.114
<i>Up till now</i>

00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:44.076
<i>The next step
was a question of how</i>

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:49.874
<i>I never thought it was
a question of whether</i>

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.418
<i>Who am I</i>

00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:57.131
<i>If I'm not your guy?</i>

00:50:57.304 --> 00:51:02.345
<i>Where am I
if we're not together?</i>

00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:05.886
<i>Forever</i>

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.771
<i>Now I know
you're my true North</i>

00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:12.316
<i>'Cause I am lost in the woods</i>

00:51:12.486 --> 00:51:15.149
<i>Up is down
Day is night</i>

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.698
<i>When you're not there</i>

00:51:18.867 --> 00:51:21.575
<i>Oh, you're my only landmark</i>

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:25.322
<i>So I'm lost in the woods</i>

00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:30.206
<i>Wondering if you still care</i>

00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:33.788
<i>But I'll wait</i>

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.883
<i>For a sign</i>

00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:40.679
<i>- For a sign
- That I'm your path</i>

00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:44.432
<i>- 'Cause you are mine
- You are mine</i>

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:46.384
<i>Until then</i>

00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:50.431
<i>- I'm lost in the woods
- Lost in the woods</i>

00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:52.982
<i>In the woods
Lost in the woods</i>

00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:54.650
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.814
<i>Lost in the woods
I'm lost</i>

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:04.532
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:31.684
Hey, Olaf, um, maybe just
one of you should do it?

00:52:31.857 --> 00:52:33.849
I agree.
She's a little pitchy.

00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:36.856
Hey, Gale's back.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.696
What?

00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:54.376
How can it be?

00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:55.582
What is it?

00:52:56.799 --> 00:52:58.665
Mother and Father's ship.

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:01.380
But this isn't
the Southern Sea.

00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:03.761
No, it isn't.

00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:18.401
Why is their ship here?

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.146
How is it here?

00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:25.108
It must have been washed in
from the Dark Sea.

00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:27.493
What were they doing
in the Dark Sea?

00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:30.788
I don't know.

00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.791
How did the ship
get through the mist?

00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:35.793
I thought nobody could but us.

00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:39.290
Unless nobody was on it.

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:42.463
There's gotta be
something here.

00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.628
Wait. Wait.
Look around.

00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:47.888
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment.

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:49.182
Waterproof.

00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:51.680
That's very clever.

00:53:51.854 --> 00:53:53.220
Although,
it does make me wonder

00:53:53.313 --> 00:53:55.313
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.941
Here.

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.995
What language is this?

00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:12.531
I don't know.

00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:14.991
But look,
this is Mother's handwriting.

00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:16.626
"The end of the ice age.

00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:18.787
"The river found, but lost.

00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:22.583
"Magic's source.
Elsa's source?"

00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:26.715
It's a map.

00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:30.386
They traveled north

00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:34.186
and planned to cross
the Dark Sea to...

00:54:34.354 --> 00:54:36.186
Ahtohallan.

00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:37.813
It's real?

00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:39.099
Octa-who-what?

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.517
Ahtohallan.

00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:42.526
It's a magical river

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.071
said to hold all the answers
about the past.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.449
Reinforcing my
"water has memory" theory. Mm.

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.568
Water has memory.

00:54:57.252 --> 00:54:58.743
Elsa?

00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:01.837
I wanna know
what happened to them.

00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:11.805
<i>Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.</i>

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.512
<i>We keep going for Elsa.</i>

00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:14.885
<i>The waves are too high!</i>

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.012
<i>- Iduna!
- Agnarr!</i>

00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:21.983
Elsa!

00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:32.156
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.036
This is my fault.

00:55:34.206 --> 00:55:36.539
They were looking for answers
about me.

00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:39.701
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

00:55:39.878 --> 00:55:41.870
No. Just their deaths.

00:55:42.256 --> 00:55:43.963
Stop. No.

00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:46.715
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

00:55:46.802 --> 00:55:49.260
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:52.593
Because our mother
saved our father.

00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:54.883
She saved her enemy.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.020
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.646
You are a gift.

00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:01.852
For what?

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.358
If anyone can resolve
the past...

00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:07.612
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:08.939
it's you.

00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:13.485
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.043
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:26.206
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.669
A fifth spirit?

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:30.797
That's who's been calling me
from Ahtohallan.

00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:33.839
The answers about the past
are all there.

00:56:34.766 --> 00:56:35.973
So we go to Ahtohallan.

00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.552
Not "we."

00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:40.853
- Me.
- What?

00:56:41.023 --> 00:56:43.185
The Dark Sea
is too dangerous for us both.

00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:46.021
No. No!
We do this together.

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.560
Remember the song?

00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:49.691
"Go too far
and you'll be drowned."

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:52.024
Who will stop you
from going too far?

00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:53.324
You said you believed in me,

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.901
that this is
what I was born to do.

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:58.071
And I don't wanna stop you
from that.

00:56:58.165 --> 00:57:00.202
I... I don't wanna stop you

00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:02.033
from being
whatever you need to be.

00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:04.710
I just don't want you dying...

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.794
trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:10.208
Don't do this alone.

00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:12.510
Let me help you, please.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.921
I can't lose you, Elsa.

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:20.514
I can't lose you either, Anna.

00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:23.812
- Come on.
- Mmm.

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:26.649
Wait, what?

00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:28.309
What are you doing?

00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:29.484
Elsa!

00:57:32.574 --> 00:57:33.781
No! No!

00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:35.491
Olaf, help me stop.

00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:37.072
Give me a hand.

00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:42.073
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:43.658
Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.584
Oh, come on!

00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:47.791
Anna,
this might sound crazy...

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:50.298
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:52.876
Well, I am angry, Olaf!

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.587
She promised me
we'd do this together!

00:57:55.681 --> 00:57:56.681
Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:57:56.765 --> 00:58:01.009
But what I mean is, I'm
sensing rising anger in me.

00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:02.848
Wait, you're angry?

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:05.222
Um, I... I think so.

00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:09.439
Elsa pushed me away, too,
and didn't even say goodbye.

00:58:10.195 --> 00:58:13.404
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:15.906
And you said
some things never change.

00:58:16.076 --> 00:58:17.442
But since then,

00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:20.495
everything's done nothing
but change.

00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.121
I know.

00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:26.163
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.254
Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna.

00:58:29.423 --> 00:58:31.380
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:34.292
Don't shush me. That's rude.

00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:36.548
No! No!

00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:48.397
Oh. The Giants.

00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:50.559
They're huge.

00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:08.250
- Hang on, Olaf.
- Huh?

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.257
Try not to scream.

00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:29.815
Found it.

00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:32.733
Thank you.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.561
Where are we?

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.567
In a pit with no way out.

00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:41.155
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

00:59:47.292 --> 00:59:48.954
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:50.834
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:51.921
no one ever finds us...

00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:53.462
and you starve and I give up.

00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:56.712
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

00:59:56.802 --> 00:59:59.294
a whole lot
better than we are.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:37.919
Okay.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.810
Oh.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:00.739
Whoa!

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.509
No!

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.243
Whoa!

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.312
No!

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.831
Of course.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:46.219
Glaciers are rivers of ice.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.972
Ahtohallan is frozen.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.679
I hear you.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.267
And I'm coming.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.990
<i>Every inch of me is trembling</i>

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:12.654
<i>But not from the cold</i>

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.914
<i>Something is familiar</i>

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:20.704
<i>Like a dream
I can reach but not quite hold</i>

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.921
<i>I can sense you there</i>

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:28.299
<i>Like a friend
I've always known</i>

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:32.132
<i>I'm arriving</i>

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:36.474
<i>And it feels like I am home</i>

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:40.891
<i>I have always been a fortress</i>

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:44.856
<i>Cold secrets deep inside</i>

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.981
<i>You have secrets, too</i>

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:53.195
<i>But you don't have to hide</i>

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.909
<i>Show yourself</i>

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.950
<i>I'm dying to meet you</i>

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.453
<i>Show yourself</i>

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.751
<i>It's your turn</i>

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:12.055
<i>Are you the one I've been
looking for all of my life?</i>

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.301
<i>Show yourself</i>

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:19.812
<i>I'm ready to learn</i>

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.863
<i>I've never felt so certain</i>

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:33.944
<i>All my life I've been torn</i>

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.329
<i>But I'm here for a reason</i>

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:41.914
<i>Could it be the reason
I was born?</i>

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:45.671
<i>I have always been
so different</i>

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.628
<i>Normal rules did not apply</i>

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.467
<i>Is this the day?
Are you the way</i>

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.725
<i>I finally find out why?</i>

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.977
<i>Show yourself!</i>

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.514
<i>I'm no longer trembling</i>

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.853
<i>Here I am</i>

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:09.111
<i>I've come so far</i>

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:12.232
<i>You are the answer
I've waited for</i>

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:16.119
<i>All of my life</i>

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.325
<i>Oh, show yourself!</i>

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:23.709
<i>Let me see who you are</i>

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:28.168
<i>Come to me now</i>

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:31.292
<i>Open your door</i>

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:36.218
<i>Don't make me wait</i>

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:39.225
<i>One moment more</i>

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:43.851
<i>Oh, come to me now</i>

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.687
<i>Open your door</i>

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:50.736
<i>Don't make me wait</i>

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:57.695
<i>One moment more</i>

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:06.161
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:09.921
<i>Meets the sea</i>

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:13.501
<i>There's a river</i>

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:14.759
<i>Full of memory</i>

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.170
Mother.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:22.018
<i>Come, my darling,
homeward bound</i>

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.346
<i>I am found!</i>

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.896
<i>Show yourself</i>

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:33.153
<i>Step into your power</i>

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.861
<i>Grow yourself</i>

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:39.118
<i>Into something new</i>

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:42.121
<i>You are the one
you've been waiting for</i>

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.704
<i>- All of my life
- All of your life</i>

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:50.625
<i>Oh, show yourself!</i>

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:16.484
Hi, I'm Olaf.
And I like warm hugs.

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.741
I love you, Olaf!

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.743
Come on,
you can do it.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.413
- <i>Here I stand</i>
- Oh.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:25.535
<i>In the light of day</i>

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.161
Oh! Like a chicken

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.709
with the face of a monkey!

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.595
I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.166
But I'm great actually.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.548
Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:36.677
I love you.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.380
I need to tell you
about my past.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.471
And where I'm from.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.763
I'm listening.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.014
Iduna!

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.637
What are you reading,
Your Majesty?

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.934
Oh, some new Danish author.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:56.107
King Runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.197
Grandfather?

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.444
We bring Arendelle's
full guard.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.735
But they have given us
no reason not to trust them.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.112
The Northuldra follow magic.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.947
Which means
we can never trust them.

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.125
Grandfather?

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:11.373
Magic makes people feel
too powerful. Too entitled.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.665
It makes them think they can
defy the will of a king.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.629
That is not what magic does.

01:08:17.802 --> 01:08:19.134
That's just your fear.

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:21.591
Fear is what can't be trusted.

01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:31.188
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.810
so they will
have to turn to me.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:39.154
<i>Dive down deep into her sound</i>

01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:43.944
<i>But not too far,
or you'll be drowned</i>

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.203
They will come
in celebration.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:49.786
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.541
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

01:08:54.922 --> 01:08:57.255
our neighbors, our friends.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.984
King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.645
It's hurting the Forest.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.154
It's cutting off the North...

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:22.940
Let... Let's not
discuss this here.

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:26.030
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:27.820
Find a solution.

01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:40.342
No!

01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:47.882
Anna!

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.729
Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.319
<i>You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,</i>

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:05.775
<i>so they will
have to turn to me.</i>

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.388
<i>King Runeard, the dam,</i>

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.199
<i>it's hurting the Forest.</i>

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:15.663
Elsa's found it.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:17.169
What is it?

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.079
The truth about the past.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.336
That's my grandfather...

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.344
attacking
the Northuldra leader...

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.422
who wields no weapon.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.640
The dam
wasn't a gift of peace.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.347
It was a trick.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.148
But that goes
against everything

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:39.566
Arendelle stands for.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:41.644
It does, doesn't it?

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.823
I know how to free the Forest.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.574
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.451
Why do you say that so sadly?

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.037
We have to break the dam.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.872
But Arendelle will be flooded.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.588
That's why everyone
was forced out.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.671
To protect them
from what has to be done.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:06.839
Oh. Oh!

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:11.552
Are you okay?

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.934
I could really use
a bright side, Olaf.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.261
Bright side? Um...

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:19.064
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.814
- Huh?
- And I see a way out.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.279
I knew I could count on you.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:34.242
Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:35.622
We can meet her and...

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:38.835
Olaf?

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:40.961
What's this?

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.671
Are you okay?

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.665
I'm flurrying?

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.090
Wait. No. That's...

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.793
That's not it.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:52.465
I'm flurrying away.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:56.226
The magic in me is fading.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.312
What?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.436
I don't think Elsa's okay.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.859
I think...

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:07.108
she may have gone too far.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.653
No. No.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:11.908
Anna?

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.445
I'm sorry.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.706
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.332
- Okay?
- Wait.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.788
Come here.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.332
- I've got you.
- Oh.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.247
That's good.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:28.545
Hey, Anna?

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.966
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.300
What's that?

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.594
Love.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.101
Warm hugs?

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:44.725
I like warm hugs.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:55.402
I love you.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:04.054
Olaf? Elsa?

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:07.941
What do I do now?

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.406
<i>I've seen dark before</i>

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.237
<i>But not like this</i>

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:22.122
<i>This is cold, this is empty
This is numb</i>

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.959
<i>The life I knew is over</i>

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.664
<i>The lights are out</i>

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.168
<i>Hello, darkness</i>

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.628
<i>I'm ready to succumb</i>

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.634
<i>I follow you around</i>

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.890
<i>I always have</i>

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:44.224
<i>But you've gone to a place
I cannot find</i>

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:49.357
<i>This grief has a gravity</i>

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.814
<i>It pulls me down</i>

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.154
<i>But a tiny voice</i>

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.533
<i>Whispers in my mind</i>

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.157
<i>You are lost</i>

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.623
<i>Hope is gone</i>

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:13.124
<i>But you must go on</i>

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:18.971
<i>And do the next right thing</i>

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.642
<i>Can there be a day
beyond this night?</i>

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:35.354
<i>I don't know anymore
what is true</i>

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:40.776
<i>I can't find my direction
I'm all alone</i>

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:46.915
<i>The only star that guided me
was you</i>

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:51.787
<i>How to rise from the floor</i>

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:56.425
<i>When it's not you
I'm rising for?</i>

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:00.386
<i>Just do the next right thing</i>

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.222
<i>Take a step</i>

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.220
<i>Step again</i>

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:10.769
<i>It is all that I can</i>

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:16.232
<i>To do the next right thing</i>

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:21.108
<i>I won't look too far ahead</i>

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.738
<i>It's too much for me to take</i>

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.412
<i>But break it down
to this next breath</i>

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.001
<i>This next step</i>

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:36.290
<i>This next choice
is one that I can make!</i>

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:42.971
<i>So I'll walk through
this night</i>

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.635
<i>Stumbling blindly
toward the light</i>

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:52.355
<i>And do the next right thing</i>

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.817
<i>And with the dawn</i>

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.943
<i>What comes then?</i>

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.777
<i>When it's clear
that everything</i>

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:04.860
<i>Will never be the same again?</i>

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.657
<i>Then I'll make the choice</i>

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:13.289
<i>To hear that voice</i>

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:16.796
<i>And do</i>

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:21.381
<i>The next right thing</i>

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:39.686
Wake up!

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:45.359
Wake up!

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.925
That's it.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.091
Come and get me!
Come on!

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.518
Over here!

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.270
That's right. Keep coming.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:23.025
Keep coming!

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:30.747
That'll work.

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.531
This way, guys!

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:44.344
What?

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.679
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:18:59.108
Kristoff!

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:00.733
I'm here. What do you need?

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.235
- To get to the dam.
- You got it.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:03.321
Thank you.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.212
Come on. Come on.

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:23.102
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.761
Lieutenant Mattias.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.218
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.724
The dam must fall.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.476
It's the only way to break
the mist and free the Forest.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:38.184
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:41.521
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:43.606
King Runeard
betrayed everyone.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.400
How do you know that?

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.906
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:52.864
Please.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:54.825
Before we lose anyone else.

01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:18.187
Look out!

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.653
Destroy the dam! Come on!

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.234
Throw your boulders.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:35.619
That's it.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.673
- I've got her!
- Anna!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.592
Hang on!

01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:18.278
I'm sorry I left you behind.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.407
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.163
I know. I know. It's okay.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.332
My love is not fragile.

01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:29.293
Wow.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.209
Look at the sky.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.418
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.753
34 years...

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.217
Five months...

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.007
And 23 days.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.668
Is it really you?

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.503
Anna.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.507
I thought I'd lost you.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.012
Lost me?

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:05.719
You saved me. Again.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:06.892
I did?

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.803
And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall.

01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:13.230
It didn't?

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.562
The spirits all agreed.

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:18.228
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.073
Me?

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:24.154
You did what was right.
For everyone.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.160
Did you find the fifth spirit?

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:30.870
You are the fifth spirit.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.621
You're the bridge.

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.457
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:38.248
And Mother had two daughters.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.625
We did this together.

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:43.628
And we'll continue
to do this together.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:45.556
Together.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.716
Elsa! You're okay!

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:52.929
You look different.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.334
Did you cut your hair
or something?

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.896
- Or something.
- Oh.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.898
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:05.612
Okay.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:07.986
Do you want to build
a snowman?

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.741
What?

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:25.883
Thank goodness
water has memory.

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:38.901
Anna.

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:41.686
Elsa!

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.897
Kristoff! And Sven!

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.075
You all came back.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.073
Oh, I love happy endings.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:51.905
I mean, I presume we're done.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:54.574
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:56.204
gonna be a regular thing?

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.001
No. We're done.

01:26:58.171 --> 01:27:01.084
Actually,
there is one more thing.

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:02.717
Anna,

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:06.010
you are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.968
I love you with all I am.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:11.383
Will you marry me?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.259
Oh.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:15.094
- Yes!
- Ah.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.779
Aw.

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:41.579
Arendelle's okay.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.089
What?

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:45.716
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.134
Oh!

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.427
Hello.

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:52.341
You know, you belong up here.

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:56.178
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.856
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.609
While I still don't know
what "transformation" means...

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:07.944
I feel like this Forest
has really changed us all.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:18.287
Presenting Her Majesty,
Queen Anna of Arendelle!

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:27.049
Oh! Hello. Hi.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.798
Sven, don't you look nice.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.013
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:35.095
Charmed, I'm sure.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:37.051
Charming.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.477
Your Majesty.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.101
Kristoff.

01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:44.771
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:46.523
It was Sven's idea.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:49.901
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:51.156
That's okay.

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:53.739
I prefer you
in leather anyway.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.790
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.664
The things we do for love.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:04.837
What is this crazy magic
called again?

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.338
A photograph.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:07.794
Photograph. Huh.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.654
We look good.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.590
Halima. General Mattias.

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:13.720
Uh, Your Majesty.
I'll be right back.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.382
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:18.388
I'm just kidding.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:20.519
- How am I doing?
- Fantastic.

01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:33.490
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.408
Hi, Gale. You like it?

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:45.836
Oh, do you mind? I've got
a message for my sister.

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:07.183
Thank you.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.817
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:14.357
"And don't worry,
Arendelle's doing just fine.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:16.366
"Keep looking
after the Forest.

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:17.947
"I love you."

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.287
I love you, too, sis.

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:23.867
Hey, Gale? We're going
for a ride, wanna come?

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.500
You ready?

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:21.473
<i>Ah ah oh oh oh</i>

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:25.094
<i>Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:29.023
<i>Into the unknown</i>

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:32.944
<i>Into the unknown</i>

<i>Into the unknown</i>

<i>Ah ah oh oh oh</i>

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:45.122
<i>I can hear you but I won't</i>

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.369
<i>Some look for trouble
while others don't</i>

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:54.291
<i>There's a thousand reasons
I should go about my day</i>

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:58.753
<i>And ignore your whispers
Which I wish would go away</i>

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.008
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:03.716
<i>Whoa oh</i>

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:08.137
<i>You're not a voice</i>

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.602
<i>You're just a ringing
in my ear</i>

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:12.900
<i>And if I heard you
which I don't</i>

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:15.194
<i>I'm spoken for I fear</i>

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:19.274
<i>Everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls</i>

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.067
<i>I'm sorry, secret siren</i>

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:23.369
<i>But I'm blocking out
your calls</i>

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.283
<i>I've had my adventure</i>

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.164
<i>I don't need something new</i>

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:30.751
<i>I'm afraid of what I'm risking
if I follow you...</i>

01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:37.837
<i>Into the unknown</i>

01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:44.391

<i>Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:53.102
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:32:53.693 --> 01:32:55.980
<i>'Cause you've been
keeping me awake</i>

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.856
<i>Are you here to distract me
so I make a big mistake?</i>

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:04.281
<i>Or are you someone out there
who's a little bit like me?</i>

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:08.323
<i>Who knows deep down
I'm not where I'm meant to be?</i>

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.412
<i>Every day's a little harder</i>

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.619
<i>As I feel your power grow</i>

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:14.745
<i>Don't you know
there's a part of me</i>

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.547
<i>That longs to go...</i>

01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:24.967
<i>Into the unknown</i>

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:32.062
<i>Ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah oh oh oh</i>

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.187
<i>Whoa oh oh</i>

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.108
<i>Are you out there?
Do you know me?</i>

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:39.312
<i>Can you feel me?
Can you show me?</i>

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:45.281
<i>Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.283
<i>- Ah ah oh oh
- Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:50.160
<i>Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:52.207
<i>Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.201
<i>Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:57.079
<i>Ah ah oh oh</i>

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:01.880
<i>Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone</i>

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:06.718
<i>How do I follow you</i>

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:10.597
<i>Into the unknown</i>

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:20.228
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.412
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

01:34:39.132 --> 01:34:41.624
<i>Meets the sea</i>

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.551
<i>There's a river</i>

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:48.176
<i>Full of memory</i>

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:52.347
<i>Sleep, my darling
Safe and sound</i>

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:57.064
<i>For in this river,
all is found</i>

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:01.435
<i>All is found</i>

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:07.112
<i>When all is lost
then all is found</i>

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:10.243
<i>In her waters</i>

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.576
<i>Deep and true</i>

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:19.204
<i>Lie the answers
and a path for you</i>

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:24.501
<i>Dive down deep into her sound</i>

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:29.054
<i>But not too far
or you'll be drowned</i>

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:35.394
<i>She will sing
to those who hear</i>

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:42.520
<i>And in her song
all magic flows</i>

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:47.691
<i>But can you brave
what you most fear?</i>

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:54.743
<i>Can you face
what the river knows?</i>

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:22.316
<i>Until the river's
finally crossed</i>

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:28.906
<i>You'll never feel
the solid ground</i>

01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:34.950
<i>You have to get a little lost</i>

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:37.661
<i>On your way</i>

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:41.452
<i>To being found</i>

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:47.587
<i>Where the Northwind</i>

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.590
<i>Meets the sea</i>

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:53.468
<i>There's a mother</i>

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:56.846
<i>Full of memory</i>

01:36:57.145 --> 01:37:01.355
<i>Come, my darling,
homeward bound</i>

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:05.188
<i>Where all is lost</i>

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.987
<i>Then all is found</i>

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:12.700
<i>All is found</i>

01:37:13.202 --> 01:37:16.411
<i>All is found</i>

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:37.592
<i>Again you're gone</i>

01:37:38.895 --> 01:37:42.104
<i>Off on a diff'rent path
than mine</i>

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:43.772
<i>I'm left behind</i>

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:48.023
<i>Wondering if I should follow</i>

01:37:48.654 --> 01:37:50.566
<i>You had to go</i>

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.943
<i>And, of course,
it's always fine</i>

01:37:56.245 --> 01:38:01.457
<i>I prob'ly could catch up
with you tomorrow</i>

01:38:02.668 --> 01:38:09.086
<i>But is this what it feels like
to be growing apart?</i>

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:11.508
<i>When did I become the one</i>

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:15.588
<i>Who's always
chasing your heart?</i>

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:18.599
<i>Now I turn around
and find</i>

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.810
<i>I am lost in the woods</i>

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.889
<i>North is South
Right is left</i>

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:28.272
<i>When you're gone</i>

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:31.149
<i>I'm the one who sees you home</i>

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:35.153
<i>But now I'm lost in the woods</i>

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:40.329
<i>And I don't know
what path you are on</i>

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:42.997
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:49.295
<i>Up till now</i>

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:53.797
<i>The next step
was a question of how</i>

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:59.428
<i>I never thought it was
a question of whether</i>

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.305
<i>Who am I</i>

01:39:03.896 --> 01:39:06.559
<i>If I'm not your guy?</i>

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:12.024
<i>Where am I
if we're not together?</i>

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.401
<i>Forever</i>

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.363
<i>Now I know
you're my true North</i>

01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:21.867
<i>'Cause I am lost in the woods</i>

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.832
<i>Up is down
Day is night</i>

01:39:24.917 --> 01:39:28.285
<i>When you're not there</i>

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:31.630
<i>Oh, you're my only landmark</i>

01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:35.050
<i>So I'm lost in the woods</i>

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:39.923
<i>Wondering if you still care</i>

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.141
<i>But I'll wait</i>

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.432
<i>For a sign</i>

01:39:46.522 --> 01:39:50.436
<i>- For a sign
- That I'm your path</i>

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:54.145
<i>- 'Cause you are mine
- You are mine</i>

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:55.900
<i>Until then</i>

01:39:56.032 --> 01:40:00.072
<i>- I'm lost in the woods
- Lost in the woods</i>

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:02.869
<i>In the woods
Lost in the woods</i>

01:40:02.955 --> 01:40:04.617
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:08.667
<i>Lost in the woods
I'm lost</i>

01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:13.748
<i>I'm lost in the woods</i>

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:06.826
Show yourself right now!

01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:08.453
Elsa, be who you are.

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.330
Oh, I will, Mama, I will.

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:11.602
Elsa's dead.

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:12.833
Olaf's dead.

01:42:13.419 --> 01:42:14.705
Anna cries.

01:42:14.879 --> 01:42:16.898
And then a bunch of important
things happen that I forgot.

01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:17.983
But all that matters is,
I was right.

01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:19.748
And water has memory,
and thus...

01:42:19.842 --> 01:42:21.754
I live!

01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:23.252
And so do you.

01:42:24.847 --> 01:42:26.133
Whoa!

01:42:26.223 --> 01:42:27.839
We live!

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:30.634
We live! Oh!

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:33.220
<i>Good story.</i>
